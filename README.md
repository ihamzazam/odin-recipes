# Odin Recipes 

A very basic website that I built following The Odin Project's Foundation. I thought of revising web development fundamentals from scratch and this is one of the first projects that I came across while following The Odin Project.

#### Here are some of the things I revised:
- HTML boilerplates
- ordered and unordered lists
- absolute and relative links
- different types of headings
- image tags
