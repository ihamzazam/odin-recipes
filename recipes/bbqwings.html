    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This BBQ sauce is unexplainable. Its not a rich BBQ but not quite a honey BBQ either. You'll love these! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds frozen chicken wings, thawed</li>
        <li>10 fluid ounces barbeque sauce such as Kraft® Original</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple-falvored syrup (such as Mrs. Butterworth's®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 - Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange wings in a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Mix barbeque sauce and syrup together in a bowl; pour evenly over wings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, flipping every 15 to 20 minutes, for 1 hour. 
            Turn on oven's broiler and broil wings until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
